# React Slingshot!

React Slingshot is a comprehensive framework for rapid application development using React. It offers a rich development experience. The original repo created by [Cory House](https://github.com/coryhouse) is available here: https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot

This fork contains the same logic but uses a different application structure. This enables easier scaling when dealing with larger, more complex applications. In addition the [Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) are also included by default.
